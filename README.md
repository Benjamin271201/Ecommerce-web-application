# Ecommerce-web-application
## A simple ecommerce web application made using ReactJS and Spring Boot
This app was made during my internship program, in order to get some hands-on experience with Spring Boot and ReactJS. 

## Technologies/libraries used:
- Front-end: ReactJS, React Hook, Semantic UI React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Yup, Axios
- Back-end: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, JWT, Maven
- Database: PostgresSQL
- Others: AWS (for database deployment)

## Disclaimer: 
  - This project (both FE and BE) is NOT being deployed on AWS yet (only the database), so if you wish to see the application in action, please run it locally following the guides below.
  - Putting both the front-end and back-end code in the same repository is NOT RECOMMENDED. Since this is a personal project, I would like all the code in the same place for easier management. If you are working in a team, I suggest keeping those in separate repos.

### 1. Installation Guide
Clone the whole project
 
Front-end (VSCode recommend):
